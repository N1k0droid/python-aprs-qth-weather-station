# python-aprs-qth-weather-station
Small Python Docker container to send APRS QTH position or weather data. It receives weather measurements via HTTP requests (GET or POST) from any device or system capable of sending data over the network and forwards them to APRS.fi in APRS/WX format. Ideal for amateur radio operators as an APRS client or automatic weather station.
